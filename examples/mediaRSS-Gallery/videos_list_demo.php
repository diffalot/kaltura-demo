Instead of chasing lost revenues through expensive and contentious litigation, or locking down content with intrusive access controls, producers should leverage this new cultural phenomenon. As a consultant, Mason helps firms understand how pirates light the way: they create markets, signal trends, and develop innovative ways to reach these markets.',
